Version 1.4+

NOTE: verion is coded in common/Util.cpp

For compilation and installation on SLC6, 64 bits virtual machine and 32 bits compilation on vm-atlas-posmov-01 (64 bits vm) 
the following packages are needed:

QT 5.4 x86 (32 bit version) in the /det/ti/PosMov directory
setup the path to bin to make sure you have the correct qmake

- the installation of qt 5.4 needs 1.2 Gbyte of /tmp space. vm-atlas-posmov-01 does not have that. 
Use lxplus to install, then copy the resulting directory over. 
It will generate Makefiles with references to afs, but you can edit those later. 

- g++, gcc
- glibc.i686
- glibc-devel.i686
- libgcc.i686
- dejavu-lgc-sans-fonts-2.30-2.el6.noarch fonts
- libGL
- make

(all i686 needed to cross-compile for 32 bit on a 64 bit machine)

MacOS X
-------
- qt version 5.4.0
- qt creator version 3.3.0
-> install libqxt (configure, make, make install)

--
to create an executable for a new architecture:
- mkdir <new-dir>
- cd <new-dir>
- qmake -spec <macx-g++> -o Makefile ../ADEPO/ADEPO.pro
? you may need to edit out a reference to GL for the linking
- make
