# When this script runs, we assume it has been called as the default# start-up script by LWDAQ/LWDAQ.app/Contents/MacOS/Wish, and that it# resides in LWDAQ/LWDAQ.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts. This Wish shell# may have been started from a terminal by giving its full name, or by# double-clicking on the LWDAQ.app icon in the MacOS finder. We want# to run LWDAQ/LWDAQ.app/Contents/LWDAQ/Init.tcl to initialize and start# LWDAQ. First we construct the name of the initialization file, using# the name of this script as a starting point.set f \	[file normalize \		[file join \			[file dirname [info script]] \			../../LWDAQ/Init.tcl \		] \	]# When this file is called by the Wish shell, the first element in# the argument list is always one we don't want to use. If Wish# has been started by double-clicking in the finder, the first # element will be a process number, starting with "-psn". If we# start Wish from the command line, the first element will be # the name of an initialization script. But we already know the# script we want to use for initialization. So we delete the first# element in argv and pass the curtailed arguments to Init.tcl.set argv [lreplace $argv 0 0]# Now we run Init.tcl with the source command. Any command-line arguments# that may have been passed to the Wish shell will be available to Init.tcl# in the global argv variable.source $f
