- then remove from libs -lGL as we do not need it and it conflicts. 

--------------
Update in QT-5.3.0:

- install in scratch1000 on afs, using lxplus, as the install needs a large 1.3 Gbyte /tmp space.
- tar the result, copy to ATCN and untar there on /det/ti/PosMov
- result will work but refers to scratch1000.
- ADEPO.pro has rpath set correctly to 5.3.0 release 
- needs libqxcb.so from the distribution plugins/platforms copied into the platforms directory (update with new release)
