ADEPO meeting


4 BCam prism (readouts) per detector. 
50 prism or so in total. 
Max readout every 5 mins. Readout takes 30 seconds (seems a lot, no async I guess)
Some way to exclude wrong prisms based on sigma

Closure mode and Running mode. Dip every 30 minutes or so. 50 records.

- Write instructions for X-Win32 and login
- Ask sysadmin for generic account or allow all to read/write detector area
- Try out system
- Need relative (resetable) floating position, and relative position from target (last closure).
